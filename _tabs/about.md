# Hey! I'm Manan Patel 👋

I break, secure, and geek out over tech.  
I'm a 23-year-old security researcher hunting vulnerabilities (yep, I snagged **CVE-2025-6210** and **CVE-2025-6209**) and repping **@NotCozyBear** in CTFs. My certs—**eJPT, CRTA, ACP, CNSP, CAP**—keep my penetration testing and red teaming skills sharp.  

I’m all about whiteboard chaos, tackling challenges, and diving deep into cybersecurity. Expect me to nerd out over systems, share insights, and make the internet safer, one hack at a time.
